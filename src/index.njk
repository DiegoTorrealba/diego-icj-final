        <p class = "welcome-paragraph">I am a junior at the University of Texas pursuing a journalism degree with a certificate in computer science. With a passion for writing and computational techniques, I specialize in data-driven storytelling, visualization and multimedia reporting. I am interested in exploring applications of evolving technologies for journalistic purposes, as well as their impact on the field.</p>
        <p class = "welcome-paragraph">This website serves as a landing place where you can learn more about me, see what I am up to professionally and academically, and have access to my projects. I am currently focused on learning all I can about databases, data analysis, data visualizations, front-end development and creating mobile apps. I also am a videographer for <a href="https://thedailytexan.com/" target="_blank" >The Daily Texan</a>, UT's student newspaper, where I've produced both short- and long-form content for its website and social media, and a student technician for the UT journalism school's <a href="https://journalism.utexas.edu/innovation/dallas-morning-news-journalism-innovation-endowment" target="_blank">Media Innovation Group</a>.</p>
        <p class="welcome-paragraph">What I like about data journalism is that it allows me to problem-solve and find answers to questions that serve the public's interest. Each step of the data-storytelling process teaches me something new about the topic I am investigating, about computing and about how to communicate results for different audiences.</p>
        <p class = "welcome-paragraph">Outside of work, I enjoy walking, swimming, playing video games, listening to music and trying out different restaurants around Austin. I also love to travel and spend time in museums and planetariums. My favorite museum is <a href="https://www.museodelprado.es/en" target = "_blank">Museo Nacional del Prado</a> in Madrid, Spain; though, the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/" target = "_blank">American Museum of Natural History</a> comes at a close second.</p>

    <p>I tend to write about lessons I've learned as a student, commentary on journalism issues, best practices when reporting and editing, and my experience with various technologies. From time to time, I'll also share personal updates about my life or talk about how much I love my cat, Cleo!</p>
