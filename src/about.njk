                    <p>I am a student journalist pursuing my Bachelor of Journalism and an Elements of Computing certificate at the University of Texas at Austin. With my technical knowledge and love for writing, I seek to serve my community by telling impactful multimedia stories that adhere to the truth and allow people to receive the information they need.</p>
                    <p>Right now I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection between journalism and evolving technologies while using computational techniques to analyze data and share information effectively.</p>

So, when I had the option to apply for both a primary and backup major, I decided to apply for both computer science and journalism, and I was acceepted subsequently into Moody College of Communication's journalism program.</p>
                    <p>For some reason, I thought that this meant I would never look at code again or be able to combine my interests in any meaningful way.
